# Suggestions
### 1) Strategic Pricing Adjustment:
Consider implementing a strategic pricing adjustment for the resort hotel to encourage higher booking rates, thereby attracting a more extensive clientele base.

 ### 2) Evaluate Pricing Strategies:
It is recommended to conduct a comprehensive evaluation of the current pricing strategies, with particular attention to rates that may be contributing to an elevated rate of cancellations.

 ### 3) Seasonal Promotions: 
To bolster customer engagement during specific periods, contemplate introducing enticing promotional offers during both the onset and conclusion of the year. This approach can attract a larger customer base during these distinctive seasons.


 ### 4) Invest in Infrastructure: 
 Allocate resources judiciously towards enhancing the infrastructure and amenities offered by hotels situated in Portugal. This investment aims to address the observed higher cancellation rates in this region, ensuring a more satisfactory customer experience.
